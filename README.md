Hi 👋 My name is James Kavazy
=============================

Aspring Software Engineer
-------------------------

I've been learning to code for 18 months now as part of my effort to switch careers. 

I started learning with Android development in Java, learning the absolute basics and getting to grips with object oriented progamming. My second project is a full stack applicaton using NextJs/React. From my experience, I'm leaning toward becoming a backend developer.
