Hi 👋 My name is James Kavazy
=============================

Aspring Software Engineer
-------------------------

I've been learning to code for 18 months now as part of my effort to switch careers. 

I started learning with Android development using Java, learning the basics and getting to grips with object oriented progamming. My second project is a full stack applicaton using NextJs/React. 

I'm leaning toward becoming a backend developer or a fullstack developer as I enjoy the functionality and business logic side of the applications I have made, rather than creating frontend experiences.
